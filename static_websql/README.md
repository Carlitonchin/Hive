# WebSQL test code

This directory contains some simple static source for working with
WebSQL. This probably only works with a Chrome browser. Apparently,
WebSQL is compatible with SQLite. It appears that a cross-browser
version exists: https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js

The various idosyncracies of SQLite are here:
https://www.sqlite.org/lang.html
